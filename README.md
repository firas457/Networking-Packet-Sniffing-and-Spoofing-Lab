## Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab
### Overview :
#### Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security; they are two major threats
#### in network communication. Being able to understand these two threats is essential for understanding security measures in networking. There are many packet sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark,
#### Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, etc. Some of these tools are widely used by security experts, as well as by
#### attackers. Being able to use these tools is important for students, but what is more important in
#### a network security course is to understand how these tools work, i.e., how packet sniffing and spoofing are implemented in software.
#### The objective of this lab is two-fold: learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies underlying these tools. For the second object, students will  write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, and gain
#### an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. This lab covers the following topics:
• How the sniffing and spoofing work<br />
• Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy<br />
• Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy<br />
• Manipulating packets using Scapy<br />
